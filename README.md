# WishingWell-For-Stardew-Valley
A simple mod for Stardew Valley that adds a "wishing well" functionality to the regular farm well.

Idea provided by TistoAries on GitHub, much thanks!

--------------------------------------

The water shimmers slightly. It almost feels magical. What would you like to do?


The regular farm well is an oft-forgotten building in Stardew Valley, not serving much purpose other than filling your watering can if you somehow made your farm far from a water source. This simple mod allows you to throw a coin(spend 1G) in it and hope for your wish to come true!


## REQUIREMENTS 
 - SMAPI 

## INSTALLATION 
 1. Install the latest version of SMAPI.
 2. Unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods.
 3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## FEATURES 
 - Once per day, you can interact with a well on your farm and choose to spend 1G for a chance at a +1 luck buff with a 7 minute duration. Multiple wells do not allow for multiple chances at the buff; The first one you throw a coin in is the only one that will count that day.
 - Translation support: English, French, Brazilian Portuguese. Chinese(courtesy of Nexus user CNSCZJ) and Japanese(courtesy of Nexus user medisons) included.

## Configuration
By editing the config.json file in the mod folder, you can change the following settings:
- DailyLuckChance: The chance of obtaining the luck buff when interacting with the well per day. 0.2(20%) by default.
- WishingWellCost: 1G by default, only integers allowed.
- LuckBuffAmount: +1 by default, only integers allowed.
- LuckBuffDurationInSeconds: 420 seconds(7 minutes) by default. Set this to 0 for a day-long buff, similar to those of certain late-game statues. Only integers allowed.
